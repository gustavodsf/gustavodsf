### Welcome! 👋
- Experienced full-stack software engineer with more than ten years of hands-on development in relevant projects (Industry, Energy Transmission, Media Company, Oil company, and Financial Sector). Usually taking part in the whole development process: from the initial research, architecture planning, actual development of applications, and deployment both on cloud services and on-premise. I have worked with multiple web development stacks (i.e., Angular, React, Spring Boot, Python, Express.js, and Nest.js), 

- 💻 Most recently, I've been focused on building web applications with unique and challenging UI requirements in the Food/Delivery industry. Our tech stack includes Spring boot, Angular, Express.js, and Dialogflow.

- 🌍 Embracing the remote work culture, allowing the opportunity to collaborate with talented people from various parts of the world.

- 📚 I love to share my knowledge because I believe that's also the best way to learn; I also consider the most essential thing to developers is to continue learning new things. I'm comfortable bouncing around technologies and love to learn new stuff.
