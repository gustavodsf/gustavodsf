### Hi, I'm Gustavo! ðŸ‘‹
I am a seasoned Full-Stack Software Engineer with over a decade of experience delivering impactful solutions across industries including Energy Transmission, Media, Oil & Gas, and Finance. My expertise covers both front-end and back-end engineering, with strong proficiency in Node.js, TypeScript, Java, React.js, and modern architectural practices such as Microservices, Serverless computing, and SQL databases.

Since 2022, I have been working as a contractor for a U.S.-based company, where I collaborated with a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an innovative voice-enabled ordering service. Currently, I am contributing my skills at a cryptocurrency financial company, developing KYC (Know Your Customer) solutions in JavaScript to strengthen security and compliance.

I thrive in distributed, remote teams and bring an agile, results-driven mindset to every project. Passionate about solving complex problems and driving business value, Iâ€™m eager to contribute my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to help organizations achieve their goals.
